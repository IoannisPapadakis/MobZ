In the previous section, we showed that there are a number of margins on which clustering methodologies
are sensitive, both in terms of the uncertainty in the input data as well as the choice of the number of
clusters. However, these issues are only important for empirical labor economists to the extent that these
sensitivities impact empirical estimates in a meaningful way. To that end, in this section, we demonstrate
the consequences of these sensitivities using a well-known paper that uses commuting zones.

\citet{ADH2013} estimate the impact that increased trade competition from China had on manufacturing
employment in the United States. To estimate this effect empirically, they use variation in the initial
distribution of manufacturing employment at the commuting zone level, and national increases in imports
from China by manufacturing subsector. Because Autor et al. use commuting zones as their definition of
local labor markets, their empirical analysis may be impacted by the issues outlined above.\footnote{We
want to acknowledge that the authors have been incredibly helpful in the process of replicating their
paper, both in providing data and helping to troubleshoot, and were receptive to this exercise.}

Their main estimating equation in the paper is as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:adh}
\Delta L_{it}^m = \gamma_t + \beta_1 \Delta IPW_{uit} + \beta_2 X_{it} + e_{it}
\end{equation}

Where $\Delta L_{it}^m$ is the decadal change in manufacturing employment in Commuting Zone $i$ following year $t$, $\Delta IPW_{uit}$ is the import exposure measure for the United States, and $X_{it}$ are control variables. All regressions are weighted by population share of the commuting zone.

\subsection{Replication of ADH}

Since we use slightly different methods of aggregating data, we compare the main estimates from \citet{ADH2013} (Table 1 in their paper) to our replication, which we show in Table \ref{tab:adhreplication}. Each cell in the table is a coefficient from a different regression, and for simplicity we just estimate it for the time period 1990-2000 (other results available upon request). The first column shows the estimates from their paper, while the second column changes the import exposure measures to our replicated measure. In the third column, we use our estimate of the change in manufacturing employment amd weights, rather than the estimate and weights from their data. The final column clusters on commuting zone rather than state.

\input{./tables/table_adhrep.tex}

Overall, the estimates are considerably stable, giving us confidence that we are properly replicating their initial findings. We now turn to demonstrating how these estimates are affected by the concerns with the commuting zone definitions themselves.

\subsection{Sensitivity to Errors in Flows Data}

First, we show how the estimate is affected based on MOE in the commuting flows input data. For this exercise, we use the 1000 realizations of the commuting zones that we generated in the previous section.

\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

[need a graph of t-statistics]

Using these different commuting zone definitions, we re-estimate Equation \ref{eqn:adh}. The coefficients from this exercise are graphed in Figure \ref{fig:adh_estimates}, which shows the distribution of the estimated effect for the 1990-2000 period. The red vertical line shows the estimate using the published flows data from our national replication of TS1996. The estimates are somewhat dispersed, with the left tail of the distribution almost 10\% lower than the estimate from ADH; however, the values are within two standard errors of the original estimate. Additionally, the distribution is skewed to the right.

Another way to summarize the results of this exercise is to look at the distribution of T-statistics, which is the pivotal statistic, and comparing that statistic with the critical values.

[say more about this here]

This exercise demonstrates that there is additional uncertainty induced by the construction of the commuting zones that is not addressed in empirical estimates that use these definitions, which may overstate the precision of the results.

\subsection{Sensitivity to Chosen Cutoff}

In addition to the uncertainty that is induced by underlying errors in the commuting flows, in Section 4.2 we showed that the decision of where to stop the clustering process was rather arbitrary, since there is no clear guidance on what cutoff is most appropriate. To demonstrate how the cutoff choice affects estimates of $\beta_1$ from Equation \ref{eqn:adh}, we generate clusteres based on cutoffs between 0.9 and 0.97 and estimate the equation using the resulting clusters.

\begin{figure}\centering
\caption{Differences in Effect Based on Cluster Cutoff \label{fig:cutoff_dist}}

The horizontal line in panel (a) is the main estimate from \citet{ADH2013}}
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cutoff_dist} displays the results of this exercise, where panel (a) shows the raw coefficient and panel (b) shows the coefficient scaled by the interquartile range of $\Delta IPW_{uit}$, since that changes depending on the number of clusters. In panel (a),  the red horizontal line is the estimate from ADH.

Again, our results show that there is some variation in the estimate based on the cutoff value. Around the cutoff value that most closely replicates TS1996, the estimate is the most negative. However, cutoff values marginally higher or lower give different results, because the number of clusters changes quickly at that point. Given the sensitivity of estimates to the chosen cutoff, best practices for a researcher would be to report estimates for a broad range of possible cutoffs.	

\subsection{Advice to Researchers}

From the results above, it is clear that current commuting zone definitions overstate the uncertainty of zone assignment, which has implications for empirical results. Importantly, this uncertainty manifests itself on two different margins: uncertainty about zone assignment due to errors in the flows, and uncertainty about zone assignment due to the chosen cutoff. 

Given this uncertainty, we have two pieces of advice for researchers using commuting zones. First, we suggest using all realizations of commuting zones, to incorporate the additional uncertainty because of the flow errors. Second, we suggest displaying results for a variety of different cutoff values. To aid researchers in this effort, we provide datasets and code online [insert url] that include a crosswalk from county to all the realizations of commuting zones, as well as commuting zones for different cutoff values.
