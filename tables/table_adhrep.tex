\multicolumn{5}{p{6in}}{\footnotesize \textit{Notes}: Table from author's calculations, using data from \citet{ADH2013} and constructed data, based on equation \ref{eqn:adh}. Column 1 is Table 2, Column 1 from ADH (2013). Column 2 replaces their measure of import exposure to ours. Column 3 replaces their measure of change in manufacturing employment and CZ-specific weights with ours. Column 4 does not cluster on state. Standard errors are in parentheses. All coefficients are significant with p-values less than 0.01.}\\
