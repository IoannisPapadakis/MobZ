\begin{abstract}
This paper evaluates the suitability of local labor market definitions for representing the theoretical and empirical goal of assigning workers to distinct loci of commuting, wages, and employment opportunities. First, we revisit the commuting zone definitions from \citet{TS1996}. We discuss their methodology, highlighting two main weaknesses that affect the resulting labor market definitions. We then demonstrate how these weaknesses affect empirical estimates from a prominent paper using commuting zones. Finally, we define an objective function to measure the degree of integration in local labor markets and maximize it over an alternative clustering method. We conclude by comparing our method to other candidate local labor market definitions in the literature, and show that it is competitive with these definitions.
