\multicolumn{6}{p{6in}}{\footnotesize \textit{Notes}: Table from author's calculations, using data from \citet{ADH2013} and constructed data, based on equation \ref{eqn:adh}. Column 1 is Table 2, Column 1 from ADH (2013). Column 2 replaces their measure of import exposure to ours, while Column 3 replaces their measure of change in manufacturing employment with ours. We replace their CZ-specific weights with ours in Column 4; Column 5 does not cluster on state. Standard errors are in parentheses. All coefficients are significant with p-values less than 0.01.}\\
